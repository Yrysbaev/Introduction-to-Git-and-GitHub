# Why do some people prefer to use Git via Terminal rather than GitHub's Mac App?

## A few thoughts:

--- A lot of people are introduced to Git via the command line, so they're comfortable using it that way.

--- When you're developing using the command line, having version control right there in the terminal is convenient.

--- The Git CLI offers a greater amount of control with respect to branching and merging.

--- If you use Git with services other than Github (for example, for pushing your code to production), the GUI client may make that difficult/impossible.
